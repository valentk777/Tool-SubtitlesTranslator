00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,082
[grunting]

3
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:08,378
[all grunting]

4
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,132
[miners shouting]

5
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:22,851
[miners bleating]

6
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:29,483
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

7
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,570
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

8
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,407
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:43,747
[wind whistles]

10
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:48,252
[wind whistling]

[growls]

00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:53,733
[gasps]

13
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:56,260
[screaming]

14
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:58,196
Hmm?

15
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,365
[growling]

16
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:04,661
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

17
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:05,954
It can't be.

18
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:06,914
[growls]

19
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,122
[miner] Tai Lung.

20
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:10,875
I have returned to
take what is mine.

21
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,194
Which is everything
that is yours.

22
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:16,798
[all screaming]

23
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:18,031
[all gasp]

24
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,220
[all gasping]

25
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:27,642
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

26
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,812
and no one will
stand in his way.

27
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:34,840
Not even the great
Dragon Warrior.

28
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:43,866
[children laughing]

29
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,785
Oh, where is Po?

30
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:48,538
He was supposed to
be here hours ago.

31
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:51,541
Ping, will you
please just relax?

32
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,501
I am relaxed!

33
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:56,212
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

34
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,798
But what if he's sick?
What if he's hurt?

35
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:00,425
- What if he's hungry?
- [whimpers]

36
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,176
Don't get your
noodles in a twist.

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,747
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

38
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,254
Kung fu!

39
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:17,549
Whoa! That's bad.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,427
Whoa! Getting worse.

41
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,822
Whoa!

42
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:25,682
[grunting] Ah, come on!

43
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:29,895
[grunts]

44
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:31,772

[grunts]

47
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:44,868
[screaming] Ha-ha!

48
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:52,584
Okay, big guy. We're really
gonna have to wrap this up.

49
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,682
Whee!

50
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,160
- Oink.
- Oink.

51
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,245
- [cheering]
- Again, again!

52
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,163
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

53
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:17,000
[chuckles] And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

54
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,735
[pigs cheering]

55
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,009
I'm late. I'm late.
Ooh, I'm late.

56
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,094
[villagers cheering]

57
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:28,429
- [villager] The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

58
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,057
Was, is and always will be.

59
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:32,934
[fan 1] We love
you, Dragon Warrior!

60
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,561
And I love you too, adoring fan.

61
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,145
- [fan 2] Sign my scroll.
- [fan 3] Sign my hat.

62
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,313
- Sign my shirt.
- [Po] Okay, okay.

63
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,755
I'll sign whatever you want.

64
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,632
Po!

65
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:42,735
Master Shifu!

66
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,386
Here, let me just...

67
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,848
There, that's much... worse.

68
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:50,159
We have to talk.

69
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:53,037
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

70
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:55,123
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

71
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:56,440
What ceremony?

72
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:58,877
- [Po] The Staff of Wisdom.
- [fans] Ooh.

73
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,671
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
- [fans] Aah.

74
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:03,840
It is said that whoever
possesses this staff

75
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:06,801
has the power to travel
between the realms.

76
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:09,721
The power to unlock the
door to the Spirit Realm.

77
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:12,140
And now, the power to open

78
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:16,936
the all-new Dragon
Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,688
[cheering]

80
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:23,067
Where the broth has kick and
the bean curd's a knockout.

81
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,593
[cheering]

82
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,238
- [grunts]
- [party whistle toots]

83
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,573
Dragon Warrior!

84
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,700
Will the Furious
Five be here too?

85
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,076
Unfortunately, no.

86
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,746
They're off on super
cool kung fu missions.

87
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,207
Tigress is taking on the
free-range chicken gang.

88
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,417
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

89
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,252
<i>Crane was crowned king
of the Crocodilians.</i>

90
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,629
- [crocodilians] Crane!
- [Po] <i>Long story.</i>

91
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:45,506
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

92
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,467
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

93
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:47,759
<i>And Mantis?</i>

94
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,827
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

95
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:54,432
Just 'cause they're
not here in person

96
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:57,101
doesn't mean they're not
here as life-sized cut-outs.

97
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,188
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

98
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,005
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

99
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:04,651
[piglet] My turn! My turn!

100
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:05,759
And then you.

101
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:08,553
[villagers gasp]

102
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,847
[groans]

103
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:13,576
He really captured your
disapproving scowl.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,810
We need to talk.

105
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,455
- Now.
- [villagers gasp]

106
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,541
Hey, can I get one of
those in a wallet size?

107
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:20,899
- [Shifu] Po!
- Coming.

108
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:22,961
[Po panting]

109
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:26,363
Do you remember the first time you
climbed these steps to the Jade Palace?

110
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:30,134
How could I forget? I thought
I'd never make it to the top.

111
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,636
Yes, but you persevered.

112
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,890
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

113
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,809
The next step? What
are you talking about?

114
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,186
I've already taken all
the steps. Haven't I?

115
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,981
It is time for you to
choose your successor.

116
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,399
Successor for what?

117
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:47,819
A successor to be the
next Dragon Warrior.

118
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:49,779
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

119
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:52,222
Funny, 'cause I'm
the Dragon Warrior.

120
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:56,911
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

121
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:59,664
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

122
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:01,624
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

123
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:03,293
Once a successor is chosen,

124
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:06,421
you will advance to the highest
level in all of kung fu.

125
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:09,531
Spiritual Leader of
the Valley of Peace.

126
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,909
Whoa.

127
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,345
I don't know what that means.

128
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,764
It's just like Master
Oogway before you.

129
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:21,394
You will oversee the Valley, passing
along wisdom and inspiring hope.

130
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:23,646
Look, I appreciate
the promotion.

131
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,275
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

132
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:30,194
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

133
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:31,362
[muffled] A cookie.

134
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:32,655
Other hand.

135
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,365
The Staff of Wisdom.

136
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,367
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

137
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:38,703
Do you really think it was so
you could open a restaurant?

138
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:39,954
Or pose for pictures?

139
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,706
He wasn't super specific.

140
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,002
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

141
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:48,963
and become something better
than you already are.

142
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:50,239
[Po] You take it.

143
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,842
No. Oogway did
not give it to me.

144
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:56,304
Being the next Oogway is not my
destiny, which I have accepted

145
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:57,597
and am at peace with.

146
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,641
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

147
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:02,268
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

148
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,436
This is an honor.

149
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,565
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

150
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,360
Master Shifu, I finally
found something I'm good at,

151
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,153
and now you want to just
take it away from me?

152
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:14,322
No one is taking
anything away, Po.

153
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:16,866
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

154
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,619
Yeah, but where's the
"skadoosh"? You know what I mean?

155
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:21,371
The "shasha-booie"?

156
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:22,872
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

157
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:25,542
but I don't know anything about
passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

158
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,585
All I know are two things.

159
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:30,922
Kicking butt and taking names.

160
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:34,008
And if I'm being completely honest, I'm
not even that good at the name-taking.

161
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:36,176
Like, who was that
fire-breathing crocodile?

162
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,679
I wanna say Steve...

163
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,013
You were chosen to bring
peace to the Valley,

164
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:44,352
and there are other ways to bring
peace than simply kicking butt.

165
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,521
Well, sure. But
not any fun ones.

166
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:49,857
Please. Being the Dragon
Warrior is all I know.

167
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,026
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

168
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,195
The Valley of Peace
needs a Spiritual Leader,

169
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,072
and Master Oogway chose you.

170
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:59,033
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

171
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,560
Candidates? What candidates?

172
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:03,979
[villagers cheering]

173
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,780
Awesome!

174
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,205
No way!

175
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,877
Wow!

176
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,897
Skadoosh.

177
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,339
Fantastic pose.

178
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:33,550
[screaming]

179
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:40,700
[villagers applauding]

180
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,726
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

181
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:49,233
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

182
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:54,088
[villagers chanting] Dragon
Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

183
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:58,116
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

184
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,244
So many great candidates.

185
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:03,247
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

186
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:06,392
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

187
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,293
What is happening?

188
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,630
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

189
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:14,299
[groans]

190
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:16,051
[screams]

191
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:20,156
[Shifu] Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

192
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,118
[chewing] Eh. Nothing about
them says "dragon" or "warrior."

193
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:25,828
You will know when you know.

194
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,623
How do I know when
I know? You know?

195
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:29,666
[sighs]

196
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,110
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

197
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:35,338
Just as Oogway did before me.

198
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:38,383
I'm not conflicted. I'm just
not ready for a next step.

199
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:39,592
What is that you're holding?

200
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:41,052
The Staff of Wisdom?

201
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,136
[Shifu] Other hand.

202
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,721
A chewed-up peach pit?

203
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,181
Exactly.

204
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:49,561
Every pit holds the
promise of a mighty tree.

205
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:51,813
Uh, how is this gonna
help me find the answers?

206
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:54,983
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

207
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,676
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

208
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:01,990
[straining] There we go.

209
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,640
[grunts] All right, universe.

210
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:06,310
Give me some guidance.

211
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,521
[Po's inner voice] <i>Inner peace.</i>

212
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,773
<i>Inner peace.</i>

213
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,817
<i>Inner peace.</i>

214
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,652
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

215
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:17,696
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

216
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,841
<i>Snow peas?</i>

217
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:22,093
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

218
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:23,219
[grunts]

219
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:24,536
Inner peace.

220
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:26,389
Inner peace.

221
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:28,725
[inhales deeply]

222
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:30,560
This is not working at all.

223
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,228
Maybe focus on your breathing?

224
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:34,981
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

225
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,817
Technically, you're talking
to you, if you think about it.

226
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:40,570
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

227
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:42,906
Wait, if I'm Po's inner
voice, then who are you?

228
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,949
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

229
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,534
How many voices do
I have in there?

230
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:48,703
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

231
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,371
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

232
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:53,208
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

233
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:55,877
- [voices overlapping]
- [screaming]

234
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,319
Anyone want a cookie?

235
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:00,989
[wind whistling]

236
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:04,785
Universe?

237
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:08,330
Is that you?

238
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,019
[inhales]

239
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,127
[chokes]

240
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,421
[coughing]

241
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,183
Attention, mysterious figure!

242
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,479
The Dragon Warrior's
here to perform justice.

243
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:35,315
[exclaims]

244
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,211
I know you're in here.

245
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,862
Just a matter of time
before I find you.

246
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:43,490
Ooh.

247
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,326
[grunts]

248
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:52,267
[exclaims]

249
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,561
You can't hide from
justice forever.

250
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,044
[gasps]

251
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:02,068
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

252
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,052
You've got excellent
taste, I'll give you that.

253
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,364
But I can't give you
that. Give it back.

254
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,140
If you insist.

255
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,254
- [exclaims]
- Oh, no!

256
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,549
He's got a walking stick. What are
you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

257
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:28,177
This stick is not for the
strolling. It's the Staff of Wisdom.

258
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,847
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

259
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:32,789
I am the Dragon Warrior.

260
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,228
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about
you says "dragon" or "warrior."

261
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,004
[grunts, screams]

262
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,431
[distorted] Whoa.

263
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:52,059
Hi-yah!

264
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:56,164
How dare you desecrate
the Hall of Heroes?

265
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,707
Who's desecrating what now?

266
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,500
Master Ostrich's Egg!

267
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:02,212
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

268
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:04,589
The Indestructible Chain
Hammer of Master Pangolin.

269
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:05,864
Whoopsies.

270
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,370
Ha-ha! [Grunts] Oh!

271
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:14,831
[grunting, exclaiming]

272
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:17,125
[chuckles]

273
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,063
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

274
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:22,631
Which I've already
broken! Twice!

275
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,802
Why would you keep an urn of
souls? Feels kinda creepy.

276
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:29,739
- [whispering warriors murmuring]
- [exhales]

277
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:32,617
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

278
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,518
- I've never felt more awake!
- [grunts]

279
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:36,478
[grunting]

280
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,064
[Po] The War Hammer
of Master Chipmunk?

281
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:41,084
- [hammer clinks]
- [urn cracks]

282
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,627
[whispering warriors gasping]

283
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:43,962
You're gonna pay for that.

284
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:44,986
[gasps]

285
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:48,656
Hello?

286
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:54,288
- [Po gasps]
- [fox grunts]

287
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:57,749
[whispering warriors groaning]

288
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,645
You faker.

289
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,754
It's not faking.
It's called Method.

290
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,048
Catch ya later, panda.

291
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:06,883
No.

292
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,100
I think I'll catch you now.

293
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:19,396
[grunts]

294
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,791
[exclaims]

295
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:21,899
Whoa!

296
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,693
[grunting]

297
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:29,740
Whoa!

298
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:32,159
Whoa!

299
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:36,724
Told ya.

300
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:39,851
You got me, oh-great-and-powerful
Dumpling Warrior.

301
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,835
That's Dragon Warrior... [yelps]

302
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,355
Let go of me.

303
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,690
Just tell me one thing.

304
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,109
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

305
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,403
That's a mystery for you to
solve during your two-year stay

306
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,821
at the Valley of Peace prison.

307
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:54,782
Valley of Peace prison?
[Scoffs] Sounds like a day care.

308
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,558
It is a day care
on the weekends.

309
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:58,745
But it's also a prison.

310
00:15:58,769 --> 00:15:59,954
[villager] There he is!

311
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:00,997
Dragon Warrior!

312
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,999
- [ram foreman] Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

313
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:06,169
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

314
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,755
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

315
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,633
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

316
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,968
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

317
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,161
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

318
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,183
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

319
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,185
Well, you know what they say

320
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:27,047
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

321
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:51,238
[Po] Every step leaves a
footprint, no matter how small.

322
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:58,638
Very clever, fox.
You know something.

323
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:00,831
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

324
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,184
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

325
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,852
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

326
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,062
I mean, what's in it for me?

327
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:08,147
The peace of mind knowing
you did the right thing.

328
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:10,692
You're adorable. Has
anyone ever told you that?

329
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,485
And I don't mean just in,
like, the cuddly sense.

330
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:13,778
I don't have time for games.

331
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:15,947
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

332
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:20,118
Maybe. Or maybe she wants
you to think it was Tai Lung.

333
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:21,369
Wait. She?

334
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:22,686
Mine!

335
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,708
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

336
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:28,000
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

337
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,127
<i>The master of deception.</i>

338
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,504
<i>The lizard of lies with
the glowing teal eyes.</i>

339
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:32,738
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

340
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,466
The Chameleon.

341
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,575
[guards gasp]

342
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,721
This is kind of a
private conversation.

343
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:40,930
[honking]

344
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:42,473
Who's The Chameleon?

345
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:44,851
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

346
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,336
So she shape-shifted
into Tai Lung.

347
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:49,981
But what does she have against
me and the Valley of Peace?

348
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:52,150
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

349
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:56,070
You're right. How do I
find this "The Chameleon"?

350
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:57,739
She isn't someone
who can be found.

351
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,533
At least not without
someone in the know.

352
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:03,411
And how do I find
someone "in the know"?

353
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:06,497
[sighs] Oh! It's me. It's
obviously... It's me.

354
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:07,790
I'm in the know.

355
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:10,359
Forget it. I'll
find her on my own.

356
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:11,961
Good luck.

357
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:15,131
After all, how hard can it be to find
someone who can look like anyone,

358
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,448
blend in anywhere?

359
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,388
Fine. You lead me
to The Chameleon,

360
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,766
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

361
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,083
Deal.

362
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,269
- [Shifu] Po!
- [yelps]

363
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:29,562
What do you think you're doing?

364
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:33,024
[stammers] There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and...

365
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:35,109
That's a job for
the Furious Five.

366
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:38,154
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

367
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,031
Look, I know that
change is difficult

368
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:42,575
and that you enjoy being
the Dragon Warrior,

369
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,036
but your job is
finding a successor.

370
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,498
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

371
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,208
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

372
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:51,483
I'm a red panda.

373
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,587
You know what? I
love that for you.

374
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,214
Po, this is your decision.

375
00:18:56,238 --> 00:19:00,701
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

376
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,433
- Thanks for the free stay.
- [Shifu] What are you doing?

377
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,851
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

378
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,395
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

379
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:11,479
You can't leave.

380
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:14,732
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

381
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:17,944
You are supposed to be passing
along wisdom and inspiring hope!

382
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,697
Just think of it as one last
Dragon Warrior adventure.

383
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,074
I'll be back soon. Tell
my dads I love 'em.

384
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:25,434
- I can't hear you anymore! Bye!
- [honks]

385
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:27,602
[groans]

386
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:31,457
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

387
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:33,126
That's a good back scratcher.

388
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,460
- Yoink!
- Hey!

389
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:36,713
So, does this really unlock
the door to the Spirit Realm?

390
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:38,339
It doesn't work like that.

391
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:41,134
It has to be given in
order to gain its powers.

392
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:44,095
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

393
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,847
No! What do you take me for?

394
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:46,931
An easy mark.

395
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:48,016
What's an easy mark?

396
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,684
Someone who's easy
to steal from,

397
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,895
usually because they're
generous and too trusting.

398
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,087
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

399
00:19:56,423 --> 00:20:00,778
I heard The Chameleon is a monster with
an appetite of a thousand predators,

400
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,906
and her favorite food is panda.

401
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,701
They say this Chameleon
character has magical powers.

402
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:10,455
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

403
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,998
[bunnies crying]

404
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:15,919
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

405
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:17,444
Or you.

406
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:23,009
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

407
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,803
[bunny] Po's going to take
down an evil sorceress?

408
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:27,764
The... The Chameleon?

409
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:31,100
[chuckles] Well, a Dragon
Warrior's work is never done.

410
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:34,354
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming
up with a convicted felon

411
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:38,233
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

412
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:43,196
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

413
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,405
He's always come out on top.

414
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:46,616
You're right. You're right.

415
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,493
But what if you're wrong?

416
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,245
Calm down, Ping.

417
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,272
How bad can one
evil sorceress be?

418
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:57,669
[bear crime boss] Who
is she to summon us?

419
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:58,920
[crocodile crime boss]
Classic power move.

420
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:02,298
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

421
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:05,927
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

422
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,637
You left out the
evil sorceress part.

423
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,514
We used to run this city.

424
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,100
Now we pay her half
the money we swindle.

425
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,686
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

426
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,211
Yeah, but what could we do?

427
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:19,399
Together, we can take her down.

428
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:22,318
- [all gasp]
- Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

429
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:26,346
She could be at this very
table, and we'd have no idea.

430
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:30,201
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

431
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:32,120
Or you're The Chameleon.

432
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,872
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

433
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,272
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

434
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:37,542
[as The Chameleon]
...I'm The Chameleon.

435
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:38,775
I said don't say it.

436
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,177
We obviously spoke out of turn.

437
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,262
Sorry, Chameleon.

438
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,139
No, no. Don't apologize.

439
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:55,643
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

440
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:59,397
so it doesn't feel good when
you're the one being squeezed.

441
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:02,066
Especially when the
one doing the squeezing

442
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,570
is just a "bug-eyed,
power-hungry"...

443
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:07,155
What was the rest?

444
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,073
Reptilian runt.

445
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:13,244
Well, this "reptilian
runt" wants more.

446
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:15,288
You already have the city.

447
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:17,248
What else could
you possibly want?

448
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:21,336
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

449
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,130
As close as the blood moon.

450
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:25,798
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

451
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,426
So little time,
so many expenses.

452
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,848
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

453
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:34,998
No.

454
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,380
What was that now?

455
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:44,466
I mean no disrespect.

456
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:47,737
Don't worry.

457
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:53,701
I forgive you for the
impudence and the backstabbing.

458
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:59,147
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

459
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:02,001
But I never forget.

460
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:04,295
You might say I
have the memory...

461
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,505
Oh, don't say it.

462
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,656
of an elephant.

463
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,160
[groans]

464
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,812
[trumpets]

465
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:23,398
[all gasp]

466
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:26,651
You think I've
pushed you too far?

467
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:30,822
Then you, my friend,
can't begin to fathom

468
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:34,683
just how far I can push.

469
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:38,037
[grunting, groaning]

470
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:39,479
[whimpering]

471
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:43,775
I'll expect your
tributes by dawn.

472
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,716
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

473
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,801
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

474
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:54,679
But it does take the occasional
time-out for snack age.

475
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,472
Wanna split my almond cookie?

476
00:23:56,496 --> 00:24:00,059
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

477
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,437
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

478
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:03,397
The "bam-what-le"?

479
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:05,440
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

480
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,049
Do you want the cookie or not?

481
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:10,344
- [grunting]
- [crunching]

482
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,512
I got my eye on you.

483
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:16,993
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

484
00:24:17,017 --> 00:24:18,226
Just a little farther.

485
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:33,092
[both screaming]

486
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:36,638
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

487
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:40,308
Well, I... I... I... didn't
wanna miss the blood moon rising.

488
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:43,061
Oh, pooh. You are just
as worried as I am.

489
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,479
All right, all right.

490
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:47,315
I know pandas come across
as calm, gentle and chill,

491
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:49,651
but... [chuckles]
...the truth is

492
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:51,236
I'm kinda freaking out!

493
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,278
So am I.

494
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:56,574
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

495
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:59,452
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured? [Gasps]

496
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,395
[both] Our baby!

497
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:03,957
Okay, okay.

498
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:06,209
Maybe Po has finally
met his match,

499
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:10,171
but there is still something that
he has that The Chameleon does not.

500
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:12,298
- What's that?
- Us.

501
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:15,218
Now, let's go find our son.

502
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:16,427
I hope Po's okay.

503
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:19,472
You know, Li, a wise
goose once said,

504
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:22,517
"Worrying doesn't make the
broth boil any faster."

505
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,019
- [Li] Who was that idiot?
- [Mr. Ping] Me, of course.

506
00:25:25,043 --> 00:25:26,563
I was the wise goose.

507
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:28,314
[Li] Oh, yeah.

508
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:30,233
[Po] Whoa.

509
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,277
That's the biggest
village I've ever seen.

510
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,070
[fox] That's no village.

511
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:36,030
That's Juniper City.

512
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:37,865
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

513
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:39,409
Just a boat ride away.

514
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,995
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

515
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,955
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

516
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:46,899
For the right price, those cutthroats
will take us anywhere we want to go.

517
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:50,545
Of course, we could always opt
for the four-finger discount.

518
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:51,862
No stealing.

519
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:54,340
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

520
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:56,217
Well, that sounds inviting.

521
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,826
[screams, grunts]

522
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:03,165
Anybody lose a rabbit?

523
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,355
[grunts, groans]

524
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:10,648
Stir faster!

525
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,984
[whimpering]

526
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:16,154
Welcome to the
Happy Bunny Tavern.

527
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:19,014
I'll find us a ride. Maybe
you can get us some food.

528
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:20,974
And stay out of trouble.

529
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:24,579
Hey, what you guys playing?

530
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:26,331
Mah-jongg.

531
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:27,999
And the stakes are high.

532
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:29,083
Can I play?

533
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:32,527
Surely you'll go easy on a
beginner, 'cause I'm very beginning.

534
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:34,173
[gamblers chuckle]

535
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:36,382
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

536
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,259
A boat ride to Juniper City.

537
00:26:38,283 --> 00:26:39,368
Ask this guy.

538
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,078
[exhales]

539
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:43,890
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

540
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,457
- [coin clinks]
- Thanks.

541
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,518
[grunts]

542
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:48,561
[sighs]

543
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:51,356
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

544
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,233
Never played before, huh?

545
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:55,235
I'm sorry, are you
accusing me of cheating?

546
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,528
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

547
00:26:57,552 --> 00:26:59,554
I am the manager.

548
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:04,244
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper
City, but I won't carry anything illegal.

549
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:05,620
I don't want any trouble.

550
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:07,580
[chuckles] Trouble runs from me.

551
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:09,040
[squawks] Then it'll
cost you double.

552
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:11,584
I'm confused. Should I have
said that I like trouble?

553
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:13,419
In that case, it'll
cost you triple.

554
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:16,113
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go
back to the double price?

555
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:20,510
You got a deal.

556
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:23,495
Great. Do I shake his
hand or your hand?

557
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:25,890
Can I get anything
else for you, ma'am?

558
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:27,350
Yes. Everything, again.

559
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:29,394
Except for the broth.
It was very bland.

560
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:31,003
- Keep stirring!
- [yelps]

561
00:27:32,504 --> 00:27:35,173
Whoa! One of everything
is my go-to order.

562
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:37,193
But how did you pay for this?

563
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,153
Legally. Lawfully.
Fair and square.

564
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:40,637
- I'm proud of you.
- [grunts]

565
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,142
- [gamblers gasp]
- [boar snorts]

566
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:46,977
[gasps]

567
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,439
[boar grunting, snorting]

568
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:52,709
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

569
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:55,628
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

570
00:27:55,652 --> 00:28:00,133
Did you actually think you
could grift a meal out of me?

571
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:03,201
[gulps] There's gotta be some
sort of misunderstanding here.

572
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:07,599
And apparently, I'm the
one misunderstanding.

573
00:28:07,623 --> 00:28:10,727
Please allow us to pay for
our meal and yours too.

574
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:12,729
I'm only hungry for...

575
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:14,188
- Dumplings?
- vengeance!

576
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:16,149
Well, then, come and get it.

577
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:18,151
No! No, no, no! Don't
come and get it!

578
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:20,218
- Destroy them!
- [tavern patrons growl]

579
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:29,394
[thudding]

580
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:32,874
[screams]

581
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:33,941
I got it!

582
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:43,033
[creaks, thuds]

583
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:45,452
There you go.

584
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:48,848
- All better.
- [screams]

585
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:51,601
- Come on! Gotcha.
- [broth sizzles, burbles]

586
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,852
Keep stirring!

587
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:53,876
[whimpering]

588
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,216
[screams]

589
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:02,761
Oh, yeah!

590
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,268
[shouts, snorts]

591
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,771
[screams]

592
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:14,523
[creaks]

593
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,031
I'll take that.

594
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:27,411
Think this belongs to you.

595
00:29:29,162 --> 00:29:31,415
[snarling]

596
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,129
[coins jingling]

597
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:41,883
No stealing!

598
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:44,511
[screams]

599
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,117
[groans] Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

600
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:51,411
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

601
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:53,037
- [groans]
- Get them!

602
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:54,813
- [gasps] Watch out!
- Whoa!

603
00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:04,007
- Skadoosh!
- [roars]

604
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:05,741
[all exclaiming]

605
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:14,225
- [all groaning]
- Whoa. Nice move. You gotta teach me that.

606
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,352
[boar] You die, panda!

607
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:19,379
[screaming]

608
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:24,551
- [coins jingle]
- [grunts]

609
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:27,012
[Zhen screams]

610
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,849
Ah! Uh.

611
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,328
[Zhen] Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

612
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:35,288
[tavern patrons screaming]

613
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:37,415
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

614
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:40,126
I shouldn't have eaten all
those dumplings. [Yelps]

615
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,169
[grunts]

616
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:42,712
- Huh?
- [wood cracks]

617
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:43,963
Uh-oh.

618
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:45,239
[both scream]

619
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:48,635
[squawks]

620
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:49,952
Sail ho!

621
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:56,517
- [creaks]
- [tavern patrons scream]

622
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,461
[boar] Back up!
Move, move, move!

623
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:01,964
[honks]

624
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:04,776
- Not that I'm worried, but...
- [honks]

625
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,195
what if The Chameleon
knows we're coming?

626
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:09,405
Why, she could be
anywhere, anyone.

627
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:12,283
Li, would you please
show a little backbone?

628
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:15,787
I'm sorry, but bravery was
never really my specialty.

629
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:20,583
[honks] You don't have to be
brave. You just have to act brave.

630
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:22,776
Act brave? Got it.

631
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:25,421
- Ah! [Screams]
- Oh!

632
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:26,839
Oh, Li!

633
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,217
- [yelping]
- Hold on!

634
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:32,053
Hold me, Ping! It's
all been for nothing!

635
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,555
Please, no.

636
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:35,998
- I'm too young!
- [thuds]

637
00:31:39,585 --> 00:31:41,271
How was that for acting brave?

638
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,213
[sighs] Keep working on it.

639
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:49,445
[Zhen sighs] Juniper City.

640
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:51,364
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

641
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,366
Does your family live there too?

642
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,726
They would. If I had a family.

643
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:58,896
It wasn't easy being a
little fox in a big city.

644
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:02,041
<i>So I had to survive
any way I could.</i>

645
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:03,084
Hey!

646
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:06,212
[Zhen] <i>Grifting.
Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

647
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:08,864
Stop running! Stop running!

648
00:32:14,578 --> 00:32:16,931
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

649
00:32:16,955 --> 00:32:18,391
Well, I mean I was.

650
00:32:18,415 --> 00:32:22,312
My goose dad adopted me, and then
later, my panda dad found me.

651
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:26,024
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

652
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:27,591
- Right, Mom?
- [squawks]

653
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:30,445
Then, one day, a
local took me in.

654
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:33,907
Put a roof over my head, gave
me clothes to wear, food to eat.

655
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:36,284
After that, I was
never alone again.

656
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:37,493
I guess we both got lucky.

657
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,536
I guess.

658
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,914
Hey, tell me something. Back
in the Valley of Geese...

659
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:41,956
Peace.

660
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,458
what did that angry
little squirrel mean...

661
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:44,376
Red panda.

662
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,419
when he said you had
to find your successor?

663
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:47,587
[sighs]

664
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:50,006
Now that I'm supposed to
become Spiritual Leader,

665
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,092
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

666
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:55,261
Once you're on top, that's
where you wanna stay, right?

667
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:58,348
No, it's just that... What do I
know about being a Spiritual Leader?

668
00:32:58,372 --> 00:33:00,892
I can't even come up with one
of those cool-sounding proverbs.

669
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:03,561
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

670
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:05,796
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

671
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,482
Okay.

672
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:09,859
Everyone knows life's
greatest enemy is time.

673
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:10,819
[squawks]

674
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:13,905
I guess it's just easier to
hold on to the life you know

675
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,406
than move on to
the one you don't.

676
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,200
Hey, that was pretty good.

677
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:18,118
Yeah.

678
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:21,955
Maybe she should be the Spiritual
Leader of the Valley of Geese.

679
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:23,873
[gulping]

680
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,917
Whoa, that guy. He
drinks like a fish.

681
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:27,484
Should he be driving?

682
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:55,613
We've come to pay
tribute, as you requested.

683
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:57,490
Looks a little light.

684
00:33:57,514 --> 00:33:59,367
Go back out and get me more!

685
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:00,286
More?

686
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,452
But... But, Chameleon...

687
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:05,081
Go! Before I toss you down
another flight of stairs.

688
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:06,523
[crime bosses murmuring]

689
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:11,236
At last, my destiny approaches.

690
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:20,429
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

691
00:34:20,453 --> 00:34:24,082
from here to the Valley
of Peace and beyond!

692
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:33,358
They will all know the
name of The Chameleon!

693
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:34,694
[Zhen] <i>Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!</i>

694
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:38,907
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

695
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:41,951
She's gonna take over cities and
towns and the Valley of Peace.

696
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:43,661
A vision?

697
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,204
While you were asleep?

698
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:46,623
I'm pretty sure
that's just a dream.

699
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,416
Not a dream, a vision.

700
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,501
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

701
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,337
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

702
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:54,339
We got to get to The
Chameleon and take her down.

703
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:56,299
Well, then you're in luck.

704
00:34:56,323 --> 00:34:58,492
Welcome to Juniper City.

705
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:05,123
Whoa!

706
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:10,396
[Zhen] This is the place where
you can be whatever you wanna be,

707
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,690
do whatever you wanna do,

708
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:15,985
and steal whatever
you wanna steal.

709
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:17,070
Uh, if that's your thing.

710
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:20,698
Land ho!

711
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:21,950
[Po, Zhen grunt]

712
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:23,934
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

713
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,272
[grunts]

714
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:35,361
Ah!

715
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:37,590
- Whoa!
- Move!

716
00:35:37,614 --> 00:35:39,342
- Look out!
- Sorry!

717
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,450
Out of the way!

718
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:43,221
I've never seen so
much traffic before.

719
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:45,306
[Zhen] You don't have rush
hour in the Valley of Peace?

720
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,624
No one's ever in that
much of a rush. Oof.

721
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:50,669
Come on!

722
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:57,193
Well, sure is good
to be home again.

723
00:35:57,217 --> 00:35:59,028
The sights. The sounds.

724
00:35:59,052 --> 00:36:01,763
[sniffs] The smells.

725
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:05,952
[panting]

726
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:09,605
It's a wonton wonderland!
[chuckles, whoops]

727
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,774
Yeah!

728
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,045
[laughs]

729
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,672
- [panting]
- [Zhen] Po. Po!

730
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:19,173
Focus!

731
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,259
This city is the most
amazing place I've ever seen!

732
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:24,637
I used to feel the same way until
The Chameleon got her claws into it.

733
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,997
- [pig whimpering]
- [thugs chuckling]

734
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:29,267
- [growls]
- [yelps]

735
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,895
- [growls]
- [bleats]

736
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,211
[growling, chuckling]

737
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:38,026
Tonight, we take
down The Chameleon.

738
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,152
Oh, yeah.

739
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:42,822
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

740
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:45,891
Is she lurking in that villainous
tower dominating the city?

741
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:48,661
How'd you know?

742
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:50,663
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

743
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:51,748
Let's keep moving.

744
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:53,166
- [citizen] Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

745
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,334
Long time no see.

746
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:55,252
How you doing, Zhen?

747
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:57,503
Wow, you're quite
the local celeb.

748
00:36:57,527 --> 00:37:00,781
Yeah, well, let's just say a
face like mine is hard to forget.

749
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,595
What? You're a wanted criminal?

750
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:09,182
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

751
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:11,184
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

752
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,518
Don't worry.

753
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,729
The law has better things
to do than look for me.

754
00:37:14,753 --> 00:37:17,357
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

755
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:18,483
Must be a slow workweek.

756
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:19,734
I'll handle this.

757
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:22,904
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

758
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:26,366
The fox and I are here on
official Dragon Warrior biz.

759
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,992
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

760
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:29,452
Dragon Warrior.

761
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:31,746
Anyone? Nothing?

762
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,772
Perhaps you know me better as

763
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,900
the Kung Fu Panda!

764
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:39,921
- [metal clanging]
- Wait, wait!

765
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:41,798
[chuckling] Can you
believe that guy?

766
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:42,966
Aw, come on!

767
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,285
Okay, so we tried it your
way. Now we try it mine.

768
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:52,684
- Wait, what's your way... [screams, grunts]
- [grunts]

769
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,792
Sorry.

770
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:56,878
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

771
00:37:57,504 --> 00:38:00,066
You can't run away from the
law. You're a wanted criminal!

772
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,777
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

773
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:05,071
Wow. City life
really is fast-paced.

774
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,031
We gotta get out of here
before they call for...

775
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:08,140
[rumbling]

776
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:10,577
backup.

777
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:12,102
[bulls grunting, bleating]

778
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:16,749
That's a lot of bull.

779
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,317
- Run!
- [gasps]

780
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:21,737
[grunts]

781
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:23,821
[grunts]

782
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:26,885
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh! [Whimpers]

783
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:28,452
[blusters]

784
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,621
[grunting]

785
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,582
[both screaming]

786
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,252
Ow!

787
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:38,961
[pig squeals]

788
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:40,797
[pigs whimpering]

789
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,403
[Po shouts]

790
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:46,905
[all exclaiming]

791
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,323
[pedestrians yelp]

792
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:49,782
[screaming]

793
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:52,410
- [grunting]
- [both gasp]

794
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,478
- [grunting]
- [snorts]

795
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:58,398
[Po yelps]

796
00:38:59,024 --> 00:39:00,710
[groaning]

797
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:01,777
[screams]

798
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:05,864
Let's go.

799
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:09,576
Whoa! Whoa!

800
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:12,096
[citizens exclaiming]

801
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,765
I'm falling

802
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:15,624
very slowly.

803
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,310
[yelps]

804
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,711
Ow! [Screaming]

805
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:24,716
[screaming continues]

806
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,846
[grunting, yelping]

807
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,391
[grunts] Sorry.

808
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:34,267
[sobs]

809
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:36,770
[bulls grunting]

810
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,486
[all panting, whimpering]

811
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Whew.

812
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,166
There they are!

813
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:02,254
We don't have time
for a drum solo!

814
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,299
We're trapped. [Grunts]

815
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:08,885
[bulls grunt]

816
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:12,222
[Po screams]

817
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:16,643
[speaking indistinctly]

818
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:18,705
It isn't much farther now.

819
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:21,398
You always say that, and
it's always so much farther.

820
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:26,504
Whoa. What is this place?

821
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:27,964
Home sweet home.

822
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:31,575
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

823
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:37,122
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

824
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,811
[Po] Uh-oh.

825
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:44,087
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

826
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,482
[snarling]

827
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:48,693
[Po screams]

828
00:40:48,717 --> 00:40:49,777
Ooh!

829
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:50,945
[bunnies snarling]

830
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:53,722
[Po exclaiming]

831
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:56,224
Ow!

832
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:03,499
Oh! [Giggling]

833
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:05,752
So you're friends
with all these people?

834
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:07,045
They're practically family.

835
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,403
Zhen!

836
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:10,447
[pipes rattling]

837
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,720
Oh! Is that really you?

838
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:18,181
Han, my old mentor.

839
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:21,142
I always knew someday you'll find
your way home back to the den.

840
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,626
And when you did

841
00:41:24,211 --> 00:41:27,232
I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

842
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:28,566
Family, huh?

843
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,901
More like distant cousins.

844
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,819
All right. How
should we do this?

845
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:34,989
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

846
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:38,409
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

847
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:41,162
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

848
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:42,705
- Hooray!
- Yay!

849
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:44,290
You really don't wanna do this.

850
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:45,375
And why is that?

851
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:47,627
Because if you so much
as lay one claw on me,

852
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:49,319
you're gonna have to answer to

853
00:41:50,028 --> 00:41:52,006
the Dragon Warrior.

854
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,658
[whispering] Warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior, warrior.

855
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:56,928
Who?

856
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:58,704
[crowd murmuring]

857
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:02,642
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

858
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,084
Introduce them, Po,

859
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:07,146
to your fists.

860
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,755
[crowd muttering]

861
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:16,406
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

862
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,408
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

863
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:20,285
Yes, now.

864
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,621
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner
Shifus have differing opinions?

865
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:24,998
We are in total agreement

866
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:27,000
with our mutual disappointment

867
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,191
[both] in you.

868
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:31,028
Wait.

869
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:35,699
He who resorts to violence now

870
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:40,221
will only find more
violence later.

871
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,245
[crowd] Huh?

872
00:42:42,706 --> 00:42:46,728
So what you're saying is, if we
don't hurt Zhen a little now...

873
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:48,688
We can hurt her a lot later.

874
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:50,523
What? No, that's
not what I said.

875
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:54,569
Yes! And more violence later is
better than less violence now.

876
00:42:54,593 --> 00:42:56,946
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of...

877
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,364
- More violence!
- Hooray!

878
00:42:58,388 --> 00:43:00,950
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

879
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:03,077
You know, that panda makes
a lot of good points.

880
00:43:03,101 --> 00:43:06,706
- I like it.
- [bunnies] Violence, violence, violence.

881
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,916
No, no, no! Wait!

882
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,000
Come back!

883
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:10,984
I'll come up with better wisdom.

884
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:13,946
You have got to
workshop those proverbs.

885
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:17,967
- [Po] Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

886
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:19,802
[Po] The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

887
00:43:19,826 --> 00:43:21,721
Those are both
very common names.

888
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:23,514
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

889
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:25,183
Trained by Master Shifu?

890
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:27,393
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

891
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,854
Everyone's heard of the
legendary Master Shifu.

892
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:30,921
But not you.

893
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:34,383
Did someone say
"legendary"? Bring it in.

894
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,737
Look, Han.

895
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:40,740
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

896
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:42,450
and I was hoping you
could help me out.

897
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:44,309
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

898
00:43:44,977 --> 00:43:46,246
[sizzles]

899
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,749
Oh! [Giggling]

900
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:52,877
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

901
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:54,420
And why should I help you?

902
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:57,090
Because deep down beneath
that iron-scaled exterior

903
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:58,591
is a good-hearted soul

904
00:43:58,615 --> 00:44:00,534
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

905
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:02,679
Fine.

906
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:06,248
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

907
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:07,893
Sleep tight.

908
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:10,085
[Han chuckling]

909
00:44:12,337 --> 00:44:14,232
So tonight, we take
down The Chameleon.

910
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:15,841
After you get your pants back.

911
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:18,403
Not cool! You guys...

912
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:20,029
Come on! Give them back.

913
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:21,447
Those are custom.

914
00:44:21,471 --> 00:44:23,599
[apes shrieking]

915
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:31,189
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

916
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:34,401
Oh! Oh, my tail. [Grunts]

917
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,547
I'm sure everything is fine.

918
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:39,007
This is a restaurant.

919
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:42,010
These are my people. We
speak the same language.

920
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:43,285
You wait here.

921
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:47,140
Salutations!

922
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:49,726
I'm so sorry to
interrupt. [Chuckles]

923
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,185
I know you're
having a good time,

924
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:55,881
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

925
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:57,925
There was a panda here.

926
00:44:58,592 --> 00:44:59,652
You know him?

927
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:02,471
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

928
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:04,473
[quacking]

929
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,767
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

930
00:45:07,392 --> 00:45:10,979
You need to pay for what
your son did to my tavern.

931
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:14,274
[glass shatters]

932
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,254
My boy wouldn't have
done this for no reason.

933
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:20,215
Is it possible your
broth was bland?

934
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,615
Try it.

935
00:45:22,115 --> 00:45:24,344
[exclaims] No, no!

936
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,346
The broth smells excellent.

937
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:30,099
You should not add a single
thing, especially not me!

938
00:45:30,123 --> 00:45:31,667
[Li] Hands off the goose.

939
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:34,753
[tavern patrons gasping]

940
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:36,648
The panda's back.

941
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:38,107
- He's back?
- He's back?

942
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:39,216
No.

943
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:42,946
But you're about to wish he was,

944
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,406
'cause if you think he
made a mess of this place,

945
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,368
you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

946
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:51,353
Everything he learned,
he learned from me.

947
00:45:53,855 --> 00:45:55,566
Except one thing.

948
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:57,149
Mercy.

949
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,822
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

950
00:46:03,156 --> 00:46:06,636
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

951
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,015
The easy way, in which
you tell me where he is,

952
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,100
or the hard way,

953
00:46:12,124 --> 00:46:14,852
in which you tell
me where he is,

954
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,813
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

955
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:18,213
because you have no teeth.

956
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:23,695
[tavern patrons gasp]

957
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:25,446
[gasps, whimpers]

958
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,864
Mah-jongg.

959
00:46:26,888 --> 00:46:29,975
I eat mah-jongg
tiles for breakfast!

960
00:46:35,564 --> 00:46:36,666
[groans]

961
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,483
[tavern patrons growling]

962
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,821
[grunts, exclaims]

963
00:46:46,158 --> 00:46:47,784
[wood creaking]

964
00:46:50,704 --> 00:46:51,557
[quacks]

965
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:53,248
[tavern patrons shouting]

966
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:57,478
[gasping]

967
00:46:57,502 --> 00:46:58,688
Huh?

968
00:46:58,712 --> 00:47:01,089
[wood creaking]

969
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:06,053
- [chuckles]
- [tavern patrons clamoring]

970
00:47:08,555 --> 00:47:09,556
[clamoring continues]

971
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:11,784
Stay there!

972
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:12,827
Where's our son?

973
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:14,704
He took a boat to Juniper City.

974
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:15,896
Which way?

975
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:19,125
You know, a wise goose once...

976
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,418
Time to go.

977
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:21,753
Uh, yeah. Right.

978
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:22,986
[sighs]

979
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:24,988
[tavern patrons screaming]

980
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:30,410
[tavern patrons
coughing, groaning]

981
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:34,498
[groans]

982
00:47:35,123 --> 00:47:36,124
[cheering]

983
00:47:40,879 --> 00:47:42,297
[citizens chattering]

984
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:50,973
[giggling]

985
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,118
Okay, let's try this again.

986
00:47:54,142 --> 00:47:58,897
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

987
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:02,710
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

988
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:04,546
Not gonna happen with a broom.

989
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,713
Yeah? Still not bad though.

990
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:11,052
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

991
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:12,512
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

992
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,705
- And "ska-blam" is?
- [fireworks explode]

993
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,561
[ape yelps]

994
00:48:19,585 --> 00:48:20,669
[all] Ska-blam!

995
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:25,632
[sighs]

996
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:29,779
I gotta say, you're not like any
of the other masters I've met.

997
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:31,906
Yeah, I know. There's
not a lot of pandas.

998
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,826
No, you're, like, a good guy.

999
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,245
Listen up. The coast is clear.

1000
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,706
Thieves, hit the streets.

1001
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,040
And you two,

1002
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:42,733
get out of my sight.

1003
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:55,537
Huh?

1004
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,316
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

1005
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,068
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

1006
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:13,406
I gotta say, Zhen, you really
are a fox of your word.

1007
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,533
A chewed-up peach pit?

1008
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:18,518
One from Master Oogway's
peach tree of heavenly wisdom.

1009
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:21,873
Eh, it's a Valley
of Peace thing.

1010
00:49:21,897 --> 00:49:26,151
It's supposed to remind me that every
pit holds the promise of a mighty tree.

1011
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:30,155
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

1012
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:37,722
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1013
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:40,600
As a wise Spiritual
Leader once said,

1014
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:45,671
how may one kick butt, if one
doesn't seek a butt to kick?

1015
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:49,901
You're a real piece of
work, you know that?

1016
00:49:49,925 --> 00:49:51,152
Thank you.

1017
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:53,780
Wait, was that a
compliment or an insult?

1018
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:54,930
[Zhen] Yes.

1019
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,396
- [citizens chattering]
- [whimpering]

1020
00:50:03,564 --> 00:50:04,564
Whoa.

1021
00:50:05,357 --> 00:50:07,544
[yelping]

1022
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:09,111
Have you seen our son?

1023
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:11,530
[grunts]

1024
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:14,992
[yelps, breathes heavily]

1025
00:50:16,118 --> 00:50:17,220
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1026
00:50:17,244 --> 00:50:18,513
- Nope.
- Nah.

1027
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:20,473
Tell us you've seen our son.

1028
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:21,665
[squawks]

1029
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,419
Wait, why are they
leaving? You said yes.

1030
00:50:26,253 --> 00:50:29,023
Hey, look. Po was here.

1031
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,484
Amazing, Li, but
how can you tell?

1032
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:34,529
Oh, we pandas have a gift for
seeing what others cannot.

1033
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:36,972
Come on. There may be
more clues up ahead.

1034
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,647
- [guards snoring]
- [gasps]

1035
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,698
[shushes]

[snoring continues]

[gasps]

1038
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,545
[clanging]

1039
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:13,383
[sighs] Why?

1040
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:15,469
[grunts]

1041
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:28,398
[guard grunts, coughs]

1042
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,320
[flatulence]

1043
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:36,240
- [guards snarling]
- [Po screams]

[gong crashes]

1045
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,710
[both screaming]

00:51:49,294 --> 00:51:51,255
[metal clanging]

1047

[grunting]

1050
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:07,705
That was close.

1051
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,082
- [Zhen] Look out!
- [chains jingle]

1052
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:10,357
Huh?

1053
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:14,236
- Po!
- Stand back.

1054
00:52:16,822 --> 00:52:18,365
- [footsteps approaching]
- Whoa!

1055
00:52:19,908 --> 00:52:22,327
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

1056
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:29,060
[Po strains, grunts]

1057
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:30,144
It's no use.

1058
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:33,064
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

1059
00:52:33,088 --> 00:52:35,257
All right, stand
back. Here I go.

1060
00:52:37,384 --> 00:52:38,427
Zhen?

1061
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,222
Where are you taking my staff?

1062
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,911
I think you mean my staff?

1063
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:50,748
You gave it to Zhen, and
now Zhen has given it to me.

1064
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:53,960
"Given to gain," I
believe, is how it works?

1065
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:55,587
You were right, Zhen.

1066
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:57,005
He was an easy mark.

1067
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:58,381
Zhen...

1068
00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:01,551
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

1069
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:03,553
[chuckles] I taught her that.

1070
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:06,264
And you thought my
apprentice was your friend?

1071
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:07,515
Apprentice?

1072
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:09,434
She's the one that took you in?

1073
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,853
Best thing that ever
happened to her.

1074
00:53:11,877 --> 00:53:15,231
You should have seen the little
guttersnipe before I found her.

1075
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:17,341
<i>Mangy and half-starved,</i>

1076
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:21,845
<i>hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.</i>

1077
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:23,931
[gasps]

1078
00:53:35,442 --> 00:53:37,903
[grunting]

1079
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:44,993
[The Chameleon] <i>She had no fear.</i>

1080
00:53:46,328 --> 00:53:47,788
<i>Such potential.</i>

1081
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:56,088
So I took her in.

1082
00:53:57,673 --> 00:53:59,943
I made her what she is today.

1083
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:01,527
Stand up straight.

1084
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:02,695
Yes, master.

1085
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,366
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

1086
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,450
Why?

1087
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:13,355
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

1088
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:15,375
I wanted respect and power.

1089
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:18,127
I wanted to be a
master of kung fu.

1090
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:19,212
Say what?

1091
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:22,799
I was turned away from every
training hall I went to.

1092
00:54:22,823 --> 00:54:26,886
They would say I was
too small, too lowly,

1093
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,098
and that kung fu
was not my destiny.

1094
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:33,351
And so, I chose
a different path.

1095
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,103
Sorcery.

1096
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:36,378
I grew.

1097
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:38,648
I excelled.

1098
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:42,485
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

1099
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:45,446
- Everything except kung fu.
- [roars]

1100
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,683
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

1101
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:54,914
You see, Po, kung fu may
be performed by the body,

1102
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:58,001
but its secrets are
housed in the spirit.

1103
00:54:58,025 --> 00:55:00,628
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm...

1104
00:55:00,652 --> 00:55:02,839
You're gonna steal
Tai Lung's kung fu.

1105
00:55:02,863 --> 00:55:06,426
His and those of every master
villain that came before me.

1106
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:11,347
And once I do, no one will
dare underestimate me again.

1107
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:13,415
You forgot about me.

1108
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:15,125
[grunting]

1109
00:55:16,168 --> 00:55:18,187
[chuckles] Don't bother, Po.

1110
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:23,359
Those bars are enchanted with some
very old and very powerful magic.

1111
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:27,322
You'd need at least ten Dragon
Warriors to get through them.

1112
00:55:27,346 --> 00:55:28,865
Then I won't go through them.

1113
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:31,016
I'll go under them.

1114
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:36,104
[grunts]

1115
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,483
[guards grunt]

1116
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:41,860
[spear scrapes]

1117
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:47,926
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

1118
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,660
[grunting]

1119
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:57,709
Whoa! [Grunts]

1120
00:56:01,129 --> 00:56:02,172
[pants]

1121
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,155
[door creaks]

1122
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:10,722
[shouting]

1123
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:12,641
[grunts]

1124
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:18,897
- [guards shouting]
- [pants]

1125
00:56:20,399 --> 00:56:21,525
[grunting]

1126
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:25,255
[both scream]

1127
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:27,239
- Po!
- Zhen?

1128
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,342
My staff! Hand it over.

1129
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:32,345
I'm so sorry I lied to you. I
was just doing what I was told.

1130
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:34,681
Apologize later. Right now,
I have to stop The Chameleon.

1131
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:36,432
Po! [Pants]

1132
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:37,791
Zhen?

1133
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:39,936
[chuckles]

1134
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,086
[panting]

1135
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,897
- [grunts]
- [screams]

1136
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:44,423
No!

1137
00:56:50,512 --> 00:56:52,240
Well done, Zhen.

1138
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:54,450
You never said you
were gonna hurt him.

1139
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:56,685
What's the second
rule of the streets?

1140
00:56:57,644 --> 00:56:59,247
Someone always gets hurt.

1141
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:01,356
And make sure it's never you.

1142
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,128
I just wish there
had been another way.

1143
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:06,862
Third rule of the streets?

1144
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:08,590
Third rule?

1145
00:57:08,614 --> 00:57:11,217
Some would say it's
the most important:

1146
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:14,870
No one is interested
in your feelings.

1147
00:57:16,622 --> 00:57:19,124
Chop-chop! We have a
Spirit Realm to plunder.

1148
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,020
And smile.

1149
00:57:22,044 --> 00:57:24,230
Nobody likes a grouch.

1150
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:27,883
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know
where you pick up such bad habits.

1151
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:33,449
[breathing heavily]

1152
00:57:33,473 --> 00:57:34,556
- [branch creaks]
- [groans]

1153
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,576
[grunts] If I could...

1154
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,685
[snarling]

1155
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:41,479
Hey there.

1156
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:43,774
[gasps] Whoa!

1157
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,819
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

1158
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:49,797
[gasps, screams]

1159
00:57:49,821 --> 00:57:51,240
[Po whimpers]

1160
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:54,409
- [gasps]
- [Mr. Ping] Son!

1161
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:56,620
[screams]

1162
00:57:57,371 --> 00:57:58,747
[grunting]

1163
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:00,791
[screams]

1164
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:04,628
- Now save me. [Screams]
- [grunts]

1165
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:06,940
Hi, Son.

1166
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:08,191
[branch creaks]

1167
00:58:08,215 --> 00:58:09,633
[both scream]

1168
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:13,387
It's okay. We've got
you, Po. We've got you.

1169
00:58:15,764 --> 00:58:17,116
[Po] So you followed me.

1170
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,493
- It was his idea.
- [grunts]

1171
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:20,453
Okay, okay. It was
both our ideas.

1172
00:58:20,477 --> 00:58:22,622
We only follow because we love.

1173
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:25,607
No, you followed because
you didn't believe in me.

1174
00:58:26,817 --> 00:58:27,943
And because we love?

1175
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:31,113
Well, you're right.

1176
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:33,574
I screwed up big-time.

1177
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:36,261
I trusted the wrong person.

1178
00:58:36,285 --> 00:58:38,870
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

1179
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:41,540
Oh...

1180
00:58:42,249 --> 00:58:46,878
Po, that was a very
big-time screw-up.

1181
00:58:48,213 --> 00:58:49,214
[sighs]

1182
00:58:49,715 --> 00:58:53,236
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

1183
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,823
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

1184
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,784
I was just so determined to
keep things the way they were.

1185
00:58:59,808 --> 00:59:02,954
Everyone is afraid
of change, Po.

1186
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,581
Even me.

1187
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:07,458
There was a time not so long ago

1188
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:12,380
when all I wanted to be was the
greatest noodle chef in the valley.

1189
00:59:12,404 --> 00:59:13,864
So what happened?

1190
00:59:14,448 --> 00:59:16,926
I became the greatest
noodle chef in the valley.

1191
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,052
It's true.

1192
00:59:18,076 --> 00:59:20,120
But I also became a father.

1193
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:23,957
And nothing... nothing's
ever been the same since.

1194
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,395
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

1195
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:31,006
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

1196
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:35,153
Because if things
stayed the same forever,

1197
00:59:35,177 --> 00:59:38,055
sooner or later, they
would lose their flavor.

1198
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:40,783
He's right, Po.

1199
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:44,078
Since I left my village, I've
become a bit of a warrior.

1200
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:45,997
- Strong. Brave.
- [whip cracks]

1201
00:59:46,021 --> 00:59:47,415
- [shouts, grunts]
- [groans]

1202
00:59:47,439 --> 00:59:49,250
- [Komodo dragon] Move it.
- [whip lashes]

1203
00:59:49,274 --> 00:59:50,359
This way.

1204
00:59:51,026 --> 00:59:53,695
Get those cages
up there. Come on.

1205
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:56,591
Hmm. This looks bad.

1206
00:59:56,615 --> 00:59:57,717
Really bad.

1207
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:58,801
[Komodo dragon] Move it.

1208
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:00,744
- [whip cracks]
- [Komodo dragon] Come on.

1209
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:10,188
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

1210
01:00:10,212 --> 01:00:12,815
What? No. It's-It's just...

1211
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,569
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

1212
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:19,846
That's all that panda
was, something to use.

1213
01:00:21,515 --> 01:00:26,204
Is that why you took me in? So I
could help you get what you wanted?

1214
01:00:26,228 --> 01:00:27,622
[chuckles] Zhen.

1215
01:00:27,646 --> 01:00:32,085
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

1216
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:33,169
like me.

1217
01:00:33,193 --> 01:00:35,547
And the day you stop
being those things

1218
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:39,926
is the day when, yes, you
stop being useful to me.

1219
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:43,537
So for both of our
sakes, don't change.

1220
01:00:44,288 --> 01:00:46,081
[skylight unlocks]

1221
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:55,650
Tonight, when the blood moon rises to
its highest point in the night sky,

1222
01:00:55,674 --> 01:01:01,573
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

1223
01:01:01,597 --> 01:01:03,015
[breathes heavily]

1224
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:10,105
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

1225
01:01:10,898 --> 01:01:12,166
[both chitter]

1226
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,610
I seem to remember
it rising faster.

1227
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,589
No?

1228
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:18,697
Just me?

1229
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:20,866
Hmm.

1230
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:24,137
Ugh.

1231
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:26,306
It's just for dramatic
effect anyway.

1232
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,291
[scoffs] I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1233
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:42,930
Bring me Tai Lung!

1234
01:01:46,183 --> 01:01:49,811
[growling]

1235
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,191
[The Chameleon] Tai Lung.

1236
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:56,252
Big fan.

1237
01:01:56,276 --> 01:01:59,130
Who are you, and what are
you doing with that staff?

1238
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:02,258
This was given to me by
an old friend of yours.

1239
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:03,760
The puffy panda?

1240
01:02:03,784 --> 01:02:05,220
[chuckles] Po might be an idiot,

1241
01:02:05,244 --> 01:02:09,182
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1242
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:11,559
Who said anything
about willingly?

1243
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:13,085
[rumbling]

1244
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:24,822
Hmm. Apparently I
misjudged you, lizard.

1245
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:27,325
Now, why have you
brought me back?

1246
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:29,494
I summoned you here so
that you could teach me

1247
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:31,579
your most legendary
kung fu moves.

1248
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:34,707
I don't share my
skills with anyone.

1249
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:36,441
It wasn't a request.

1250
01:02:41,446 --> 01:02:42,757
[snarling]

1251
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:44,992
- [grunting]
- [guards groaning]

1252
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,120
[roars]

1253
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:55,752
[growls, grunts]

1254
01:02:57,588 --> 01:02:59,274
[panting, growls]

1255
01:02:59,298 --> 01:03:00,775
[snarls]

1256
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,134
[grunts]

1257
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:19,568
[growling]

1258
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:29,470
Yes, I got it!

1259
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:31,556
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

1260
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,725
The power, the precision.

1261
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:36,144
[scattered cheering]

1262
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:37,395
[breathes heavily]

1263
01:03:37,419 --> 01:03:39,606
What have you done to me?

1264
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:43,216
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1265
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:48,573
And the best part is, I'm
just getting warmed up.

1266
01:03:48,597 --> 01:03:50,974
Bring me General Kai.

1267
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,314
Bring me Master Osprey.

1268
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:01,568
Master Bull.

1269
01:04:06,823 --> 01:04:08,218
[thunder rumbles]

1270
01:04:08,242 --> 01:04:09,302
[Mr. Ping] Po, wait!

1271
01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:11,596
Please be reasonable.

1272
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,806
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

1273
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,892
No staff is worth your life.

1274
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:18,311
As long as I'm still
the Dragon Warrior,

1275
01:04:18,335 --> 01:04:20,963
I won't let anyone else
get hurt because of me.

1276
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:33,976
[panting, gasps]

1277
01:04:37,896 --> 01:04:38,896
Po!

1278
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:40,941
You're alive!

1279
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:46,047
Please. I made a mistake.

1280
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:48,949
So did I. Trusting you.

1281
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:50,533
I'm sorry.

1282
01:04:51,076 --> 01:04:52,887
Did your master tell
you to say that too?

1283
01:04:52,911 --> 01:04:56,123
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

1284
01:04:56,957 --> 01:04:58,226
It's the truth.

1285
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,335
I was wrong about everything.

1286
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:04,023
- [straining]
- What are you doing?

1287
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:05,650
Stopping you.

1288
01:05:05,674 --> 01:05:07,527
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1289
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:08,802
No.

1290
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:10,489
Move.

1291
01:05:10,513 --> 01:05:12,240
You want me to move?

1292
01:05:12,264 --> 01:05:13,533
Move me.

1293
01:05:13,557 --> 01:05:16,143
First you betray me, and
now you wanna fight me?

1294
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:18,705
- [Zhen grunts]
- Why are you doing this?

1295
01:05:18,729 --> 01:05:21,732
[breathes heavily] To stop
you from getting killed.

1296
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:23,233
[groans]

1297
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:24,711
[Zhen grunting]

1298
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,819
[exclaims]

1299
01:05:29,156 --> 01:05:31,116
[both grunting]

1300
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:36,140
[thunderclap]

1301
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:37,623
[breathing heavily]

1302
01:05:38,206 --> 01:05:41,001
[both panting]

1303
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:46,214
[thunder rumbling]

1304
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,929
What do you care if
I get killed or not?

1305
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,380
Please, Po.

1306
01:06:09,404 --> 01:06:11,615
Just let me do one thing right.

1307
01:06:16,787 --> 01:06:19,623
You're not the only one who's
made some bad choices lately.

1308
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:23,728
You're really gonna go
through with this, aren't you?

1309
01:06:23,752 --> 01:06:24,854
'Fraid so.

1310
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:27,774
And there's nothing I can
do to talk you out of it?

1311
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:28,942
I'm afraid not.

1312
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:30,944
You can't beat her, you know.

1313
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,552
You're probably right.

1314
01:06:34,012 --> 01:06:35,430
But I have to try.

1315
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:38,993
Get as far away from
this place as you can.

1316
01:06:39,017 --> 01:06:40,078
Po!

1317
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:42,288
[Mr. Ping] We should never
have let him come here.

1318
01:06:42,312 --> 01:06:44,541
We are such terrible fathers.

1319
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,459
At least you didn't
lie and betray him.

1320
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:48,878
Well, that's true. You're worse.

1321
01:06:48,902 --> 01:06:50,797
I am a terrible friend.

1322
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:53,508
"Friend"? That feels
a little generous, no?

1323
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:55,718
Uh, l-let's just
give up. Surrender.

1324
01:06:55,742 --> 01:06:57,387
We can't let him
go in there alone.

1325
01:06:57,411 --> 01:06:58,972
What can we do?

1326
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:01,432
There are just three
of us against an army.

1327
01:07:01,456 --> 01:07:04,251
Then I guess we'll just have
to get an army of our own.

1328
01:07:11,008 --> 01:07:11,985
[chatters]

1329
01:07:12,009 --> 01:07:13,319
- [growls]
- [bunnies growl]

1330
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:14,928
- [den thieves clamoring]
- [gibbering]

1331
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:19,141
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

1332
01:07:21,935 --> 01:07:22,912
[inhales deeply]

1333
01:07:22,936 --> 01:07:25,540
Quack!

1334
01:07:25,564 --> 01:07:26,940
[clamoring stops]

1335
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:29,168
Thank you.

1336
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:31,278
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1337
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:34,281
- Who?
- You know, Po.

1338
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:36,909
The panda.

1339
01:07:39,953 --> 01:07:42,015
No, no. A different panda.

1340
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:44,249
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

1341
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,144
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1342
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:49,814
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1343
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:51,774
So, I need yours.

1344
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:53,610
Why should we help you?

1345
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:54,944
Because...

1346
01:07:54,968 --> 01:07:56,053
Because

1347
01:07:56,929 --> 01:07:58,472
it's the right thing to do.

1348
01:08:01,183 --> 01:08:02,785
[laughing]

1349
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:04,746
Stop it. Stop.

1350
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:06,104
Stop laughing.

1351
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:09,709
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

1352
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:14,464
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

1353
01:08:14,488 --> 01:08:19,551
but a good friend once told me it's
never too late to do the right thing.

1354
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:23,096
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1355
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,140
the more wrong we can do later.

1356
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:26,350
- What? No.
- [crowd murmurs]

1357
01:08:26,374 --> 01:08:28,895
And with The Chameleon
out of the way...

1358
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:31,105
We can finally do all
the wrong we want.

1359
01:08:31,129 --> 01:08:33,149
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

1360
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:35,777
- [all] Violence, violence, violence.
- [sighs]

1361
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:39,614
Are you guys ready to do the
right thing for the wrong reasons?

1362
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:40,763
[cheering]

1363
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:47,205
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

1364
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,998
was underestimating
his opponent.

1365
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:51,960
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

1366
01:08:51,984 --> 01:08:53,485
- [Po] Hey.
- [gasps, grunts]

1367
01:08:56,071 --> 01:08:58,716
Now, you see, the mistake this Dragon
Warrior fellow made was that...

1368
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,409
[annoyed Komodo] Shut up, Larry.

1369
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,433
This place is crawling with
more guards than I've ever seen.

1370
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:09,519
I'm never gonna
get to Po in time.

1371
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:12,313
You just get to Po. We'll
take care of the guards.

1372
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:13,690
We will? [Chuckles]

1373
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,190
I-I mean, we will.

1374
01:09:15,214 --> 01:09:16,425
But how?

1375
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:18,593
Just leave that to me.

1376
01:09:28,186 --> 01:09:29,187
[shrieks]

1377
01:09:30,022 --> 01:09:31,875
- [grunts]
- [yells]

1378
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:34,127
- [shouts]
- [groans]

1379
01:09:34,151 --> 01:09:35,151
[grunts]

1380
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,154
- [whimpers]
- [grunts]

1381
01:09:37,905 --> 01:09:39,172
[roars]

1382
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:40,406
[grunts]

1383
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,293
[Po] General Kai?

1384
01:09:52,044 --> 01:09:53,270
Lord Shen?

1385
01:09:53,294 --> 01:09:57,233
Those are all my old
nemesis-es. Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

1386
01:09:57,257 --> 01:10:00,278
The Chameleon is pulling
spirits from the Spirit Realm

1387
01:10:00,302 --> 01:10:02,322
and draining us
of all our moves.

1388
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:05,158
And she's using
your staff to do it.

1389
01:10:05,182 --> 01:10:07,160
- I'm here to get it back.
- [crocodile scoffs]

1390
01:10:07,184 --> 01:10:08,661
I won't hold my breath.

1391
01:10:08,685 --> 01:10:10,205
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

1392
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:12,022
Do you know me? It's Scott.

1393
01:10:13,815 --> 01:10:15,752
The fire-breathing crocodile?

1394
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:18,838
[coughing] Oh, right!
Scott! [Coughs]

1395
01:10:18,862 --> 01:10:21,132
Master Shifu and I were
just talking about you.

1396
01:10:21,156 --> 01:10:22,616
[Tai Lung] Panda.

1397
01:10:23,242 --> 01:10:26,995
Oogway made a mistake choosing
you as the Dragon Warrior.

1398
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:32,227
I just didn't realize how big
a mistake it was until now.

1399
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:34,771
Whoa. Tai Lung?

1400
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:38,316
I'm gonna get that staff
back, restore your kung fu,

1401
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,777
and return you all back
to the Spirit Realm.

1402
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:42,111
You'll see.

1403
01:10:42,135 --> 01:10:43,470
All I see

1404
01:10:44,304 --> 01:10:46,223
is a broken promise.

1405
01:10:51,353 --> 01:10:55,833
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

1406
01:10:55,857 --> 01:10:59,128
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

1407
01:10:59,152 --> 01:11:02,924
The easy way, in which
you surrender willingly,

1408
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:07,053
or the hard way, where
you surrender woundedly.

1409
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:09,871
The choice is yours.

1410
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:16,128
- [guards growling]
- I was kidding! I was kidding!

1411
01:11:16,628 --> 01:11:18,046
[screaming]

1412
01:11:25,053 --> 01:11:26,054
Aw.

1413
01:11:26,638 --> 01:11:28,241
- [bunnies growling]
- [screams]

1414
01:11:28,265 --> 01:11:29,784
- [screams]
- Ow! Ow!

1415
01:11:29,808 --> 01:11:31,368
- [bunny squealing]
- [guards screaming]

1416
01:11:32,144 --> 01:11:33,145
Thanks, Ping.

1417
01:11:33,645 --> 01:11:34,980
[guard screaming]

1418
01:11:37,482 --> 01:11:38,585
Run away!

1419
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:40,068
[den thieves grunting]

1420
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:45,699
- [den thieves grunting]
- [Han] Cannonball!

1421
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:50,537
- [Han laughing, grunting]
- [guards grunting]

1422
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:53,332
- [apes screeching]
- [boar grunts]

1423
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:55,351
- [slurps]
- Oh, is it too spicy?

1424
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:58,104
Mmm. No. It's got
the perfect kick.

1425
01:11:58,128 --> 01:12:01,357
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

1426
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,442
[grunts]

1427
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:04,466
- [bunnies squealing]
- [guards shouting, grunting]

1428
01:12:06,261 --> 01:12:07,661
- [bunny growling]
- [guard screams]

1429
01:12:08,347 --> 01:12:11,600
That panda was right. More
violence later is better!

1430
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:13,560
- [bunnies] Yay!
- [groans]

1431
01:12:19,524 --> 01:12:22,110
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1432
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:27,634
Can't you even die right?

1433
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:29,594
Can't you even kill wrong?

1434
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:31,930
No. [Chuckles] Wordplay
didn't come together.

1435
01:12:31,954 --> 01:12:33,288
Now, about that staff...

1436
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:36,643
[The Chameleon] Take it.

1437
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:39,336
I already have everything
I need from it anyway.

1438
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,106
I think this was destiny.

1439
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:46,611
A final face-off between
formidable adversaries,

1440
01:12:46,635 --> 01:12:49,447
alike in so many ways.

1441
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:51,074
If only I had a
dumpling for every time

1442
01:12:51,098 --> 01:12:52,992
a villain told me how
much we had in common.

1443
01:12:53,016 --> 01:12:54,077
It's true.

1444
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:56,412
We've both risen to
the highest of heights.

1445
01:12:56,436 --> 01:12:59,541
It's a shame only one of
us can come out on top.

1446
01:12:59,565 --> 01:13:02,168
It is a shame, for you.

1447
01:13:02,192 --> 01:13:07,131
My combined powers of sorcery
and kung fu make me unstoppable.

1448
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:11,594
And once I dispense with you, I'll
expand my rule from Juniper City to...

1449
01:13:11,618 --> 01:13:13,388
Every other city
and town and village

1450
01:13:13,412 --> 01:13:15,139
from here to the Valley
of Peace and beyond.

1451
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:16,349
Yeah, I know.

1452
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:18,434
But how did you know?

1453
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:22,421
I saw it in a vision because
I'm the Dragon Warrior,

1454
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:25,900
for now at least.

1455
01:13:25,924 --> 01:13:29,511
But I've realized that it's
probably time I made a change.

1456
01:13:30,596 --> 01:13:31,990
And so should you.

1457
01:13:32,014 --> 01:13:34,867
I'm The Chameleon. I
do nothing but change.

1458
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:36,703
Only on the outside.

1459
01:13:36,727 --> 01:13:39,455
Real change happens from within.

1460
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:41,916
And if we're really
as alike as you say,

1461
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,960
then maybe we could both
let go of who we were

1462
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:46,403
and become something
better than we already are.

1463
01:13:47,195 --> 01:13:49,674
- What do you say?
- I say...

1464
01:13:49,698 --> 01:13:50,908
[squawks]

1465
01:13:52,284 --> 01:13:53,785
Well, I saw that coming.

1466
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:57,765
We're very proud of you.

1467
01:13:57,789 --> 01:13:58,975
You tried it our way.

1468
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:01,102
Now try it yours.

1469
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:03,354
[both] Kick her butt.

1470
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:05,297
I'm way ahead of you.

1471
01:14:06,214 --> 01:14:07,424
[Po grunting]

1472
01:14:08,342 --> 01:14:09,551
[The Chameleon growling]

1473
01:14:13,347 --> 01:14:15,515
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

1474
01:14:18,894 --> 01:14:20,812
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

1475
01:14:21,897 --> 01:14:23,899
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

1476
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:25,609
[screams]

1477
01:14:27,444 --> 01:14:28,444
[moos]

1478
01:14:28,946 --> 01:14:30,906
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

1479
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:34,510
What?

1480
01:14:34,534 --> 01:14:35,894
[as Tai Lung]
Recognize this move?

1481
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:37,555
[screams]

1482
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:38,474
[grunts]

1483
01:14:38,498 --> 01:14:41,184
Is that how I sound? I
don't sound like that, do I?

1484
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:44,461
[Po] You didn't earn those
skills. You just stole them!

1485
01:14:45,545 --> 01:14:47,106
Give him a left,
a right, uppercut.

1486
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:50,693
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

1487
01:14:50,717 --> 01:14:53,446
I'm stronger than every
opponent you've ever faced,

1488
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:56,866
because I am every
opponent you've ever faced.

1489
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,890
Po!

1490
01:14:58,558 --> 01:15:00,102
[screams]

1491
01:15:01,144 --> 01:15:02,187
[growls]

1492
01:15:03,564 --> 01:15:04,582
[chuckles]

1493
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:06,066
[clangs]

1494
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:08,503
[growls]

1495
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:09,611
[grunts]

1496
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:13,216
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

1497
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,510
Nah, it was just right. [Grunts]

1498
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:16,618
[yelps]

1499
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:20,682
I knew I should have left you to
rot in the gutter where you belong.

1500
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:23,309
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

1501
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,752
- [grunts, exhales sharply]
- [trumpets]

1502
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:33,319
- [both exclaim]
- Two against one?

1503
01:15:33,343 --> 01:15:35,530
Well, now, that
doesn't seem fair.

1504
01:15:35,554 --> 01:15:37,723
I'll have to even the odds.

1505
01:15:38,932 --> 01:15:40,601
Master Cobra.

1506
01:15:41,268 --> 01:15:43,329
Master Osprey.

1507
01:15:43,353 --> 01:15:45,373
Master Scorpion.

1508
01:15:45,397 --> 01:15:47,417
Master Wolf.

1509
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:49,878
General Kai.

1510
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:51,194
Lord Shen.

1511
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:55,383
[growls]

1512
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:58,452
That is awesome!

1513
01:15:59,578 --> 01:16:01,556
I mean, it's disturbing,
but it's awesome.

1514
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,957
[roars, growls]

1515
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,460

Whoa!

1521
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:22,225
Zhen!

1522

1523
01:16:34,613 --> 01:16:36,657
No!

[roars]

1525
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,331
Whoa, whoa!

Po!

[chuckles]

1531
01:17:04,977 --> 01:17:06,645
[as Po] I thought
we were friends.

1532
01:17:06,937 --> 01:17:07,937
[gasps]

1533
01:17:08,522 --> 01:17:09,582
Stand back.

1534
01:17:09,606 --> 01:17:11,942
I'm gonna kick my butt.

1535
01:17:19,575 --> 01:17:20,576
[grunts]

1536

[shouting]

1546
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:35,960
Come on, Po, get out of there.

1547
01:18:35,984 --> 01:18:38,421
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

1548
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,048
A wise, old tortoise
once told me

1549
01:18:40,072 --> 01:18:42,300
that you never know what
you can do until you do it.

1550
01:18:42,324 --> 01:18:44,469
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

1551
01:18:44,493 --> 01:18:47,055
and you're here giving me
life advice from a tortoise?

1552
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:48,664
Be the pit, Zhen.

1553
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,999
Be the pit.

1554
01:19:00,759 --> 01:19:02,403
And what do you
think you're doing?

1555
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:04,155
Finishing what Po started.

1556
01:19:04,179 --> 01:19:07,033
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1557
01:19:07,057 --> 01:19:08,308
[grunts]

1558
01:19:09,059 --> 01:19:10,477
Don't slouch.

1559
01:19:12,688 --> 01:19:13,730
[all gasp]

1560
01:19:15,774 --> 01:19:16,984
[grunting]

1561
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:22,757
You ungrateful little urchin.

1562
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:26,952
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

1563
01:19:27,953 --> 01:19:31,683
[breathing heavily] First rule of
the streets: Never trust anyone.

1564
01:19:31,707 --> 01:19:35,103
Ha! You can't defeat me.
I know all your moves.

1565
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:36,688
Not this one.

1566
01:19:36,712 --> 01:19:40,316
Roll, stir, serve,

1567
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,443
and ska-blam!

1568
01:19:42,467 --> 01:19:45,012
- [roars]
- [gasps, screams]

1569
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,034
- [cheering]
- [chuckles] Yes!

1570
01:19:50,058 --> 01:19:53,353
Second rule: Someone

of that cage anytime you wanted?

You faker.

1574

It's not faking. It's Method.

Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

the chance to grow?

Thanks, guys.

01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:43,541
I was thinking, after I serve my
time and I'm a free fox again,

1598
01:22:43,565 --> 01:22:46,377
maybe I'll open one of those acupuncture
places that are all the rage.

you chose the fox?

know, you know?

Fine, choose who you want.
A thief, a stick, a carrot.

He's right. What about me

1613
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,132
Well, as I learned from
working in my dad's kitchen,

1614
01:23:33,156 --> 01:23:37,720
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

1615
01:23:37,744 --> 01:23:39,806
Hey, that's not bad.

1616

Okay, I see you,
Spiritual Leader.

1617
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:44,477
Yeah. I'm getting the hang
of this proverb thing.

1618
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:47,605
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1619
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:49,607
Maybe you should just
stick to kicking butt.

Money can't buy happiness, but it
sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

Why does it always come
back to dumplings with you?

When life gives you lemons, make
pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

You can't have your moon
cake and eat it too.

1625
01:24:05,188 --> 01:24:08,418
Although, I guess you could have moon cake
and then order mango pudding on the side.
